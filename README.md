# About
Howdy all, I'm a new ish programmer getting a BA in CS, I have experience primarily with Java, C, C++, and Python. I currently hope to learn more about creating 3D assests and implementing them into VR based code. I hopefully have uploaded at least 2 of my projects which should be a Java/LWJGL based swerve drive simulator, and an old python based chess program I created.
